<h1>What is geniusify? â›·</h1>
Geniusify randomly transforms letters of a text to uppercase or lowercase. Purpose is causing a mocking feel through text.

<h3>Other Details</h3>
Project is done in 3 hours by me (Artun). I used React for the coding part and <b>Open Sans</b> as the font.

<h3>Licenses and stuff</h3>
You can use my code as you wish. There is nothing much obviously . Also for the icon I used lightbulb icon from: https://fontawesome.com/icons/lightbulb?style=regular and https://fontawesome.com/license is the license for this product.
